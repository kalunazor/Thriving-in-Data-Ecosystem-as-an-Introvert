Thriving in the Field of Data Science as an Introvert
Data Science for Beginners Challenge:
Analyzing Text about Thriving in the Field of Data Science as an Introvert.
Aim:
There is an upsurge of people upskilling or reskilling into the Data Space. They do this for different reasons, including staying relevant, embracing emerging technology, learning 'just in case' and not 'just in time, work flexibility, better remuneration and what have you? While many are making giant strides, some, primarily introverted, need help to take their new skills to where their clients (potential employers) are. In this challenge, I want to apply my learning to discover more related concepts using text mining.
Before we resume this fun way of learning Data Science as a beginner, it will be great to understand who an introvert is. We will use Susan Cain's questions in her book on the power of introverts to better understand who an introvert is. According to her, the more often you answered True to the below questions, the more introverted you probably are. While lots of Falses suggest, you're an extrovert. And if there were nearly equal amounts of True and False, you may be an "ambivert".
Now, answer True or False to these Susan Cain's Power of Introvert questions:
I prefer one-on-one conversations to group activities.
I often like to express myself in writing.
I enjoy solitude.
I care less about wealth, fame, and status than my peers.
I dislike small talk but enjoy discussing topics that matter to me.
I've been complimented on my ability to listen.
I don't take many risks.
I like projects that let me "sink in" without many interruptions.
I prefer a small, intimate birthday celebration with just one or two close friends or family members.
People refer to me as "soft-spoken" or "mellow".
I prefer to keep my work private until it is completed.
I abhor conflict.
I produce my finest work when I am working alone.
I pause to reflect before I speak.
Even if I've had a good time, I'm exhausted after being out and about.
I frequently let calls go to voicemail.
If I had to pick, I'd prefer a weekend with nothing planned at all than one with too many activities.
I'm not a big fan of multitasking.
I have no trouble focusing.
I enjoy lectures in a classroom setting.

Did you participate in this introvert-discovery quiz? Where do you belong?
Data Science as a field engenders collaboration and active communication, which may come across to an introvert as being prideful. Can introverts thrive in an extroverted ecosystem? This is so broad to discourse; I pulled through this, so I am convinced that anyone else can. This is not our primary focus today; please let me know if discussing this further will benefit you.
